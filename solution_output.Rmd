This is a test [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. We will see if we can render out some alternative versions of the Rmd with different sections removed.

Here is an example code and plot.
```{r example}
plot(cars)
```

Now imagine that the section below is there for a user to fill in with their answer.
```{r solution, solution = TRUE}

```
